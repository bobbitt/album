Generating Static HTML Files
Photo Album - Generating Static HTML Files
This mode is meant to be used to prepare the photo album to be read offline. For example, when a web server is not practical or available, or if you want to burn your album onto a CD-ROM.
This will create an HTML file in each directory (album), and one for each photo. This will allow you to view the photos through this static HTML. (Normally this HTML is built on the fly by the web server). The down side to doing this is that you will have to re-run this process if new photos are added.

Add a new config item
This section is used to add a new config item to your album.cfg file. This should only be done when upgrading, in order to add a required configuration item. Note that items added through these means will not be sorted into the proper group. You may wish to edit album.cfg directly to add new config items.

Providing an e-mail address in the "E-Mail Address" block below will allow you to be notified of new releases, security fixes and upcoming features. Your address will <b>not</b> be given to any third parties or used to any other purposes. I've added a registration feature to help the album.pl community stay up to date with development efforts, not to make a buck or spam you. :)
If you still don't want to provide an address, that's OK, it's optional.
